# Welcome to ENTR-451

This is an example of a GitHub repository. 

Now I am making a change to practice updating the a file.

Commit Steps:
1. stage the changes
2. add a message and commit the change
3. push the commit to GitHub


Commands in Terminal:
1. "pwd" = print working directory (current)
2. "ls" = list; lists the files within the directory - doesn't show dot files
3. "ls -la" = show me ALL files in the repository/directory, even hidden files
4.
